                    This platform was designed as a research project to develop an online community to allow patients
                    and their family members to partner with health researchers. Our goal is to connect health
                    researchers with patients, not as study subjects, but as partners to guide health research and
                    clinical care to focus on the aspects that matter most to patients and families. This platform was
                    developed with the input and participation of a diverse group of communities, to ensure inclusivity
                    and accessibility for all Canadians.

				<Text italic strong>Data Collection and Use</Text>
				<Paragraph>
					The Platform will only collect and use your Personal Information according to this Privacy
					Policy.
					We will email you if we change this Privacy Policy or if we use your Personal Information for
					any
					reasons not included in this policy. Those users who have chosen not to receive communications
					from
					the Platform accept the responsibility of reviewing the Privacy Policy at each sign-in. Signing
					in
					following a change to the policy approves the Privacy Policy.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					We collect your name, primary email address, secondary email address, and non-EDI demographics
					(e.g.
					research interests, role, institution) to administer the Platform. By creating an account and
					accepting the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, you are agreeing to share your name, primary
					email
					address, and non-EDI demographics with other users and Platform owners and operators. This is
					necessary for communication and identification of relevant groups for surveys, projects and
					other
					targeted information.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					We collect EDI demographic information (e.g. gender, population group, disability) using the
					Government of Canada Convergence Portal Equity and Diversity Questionnaire, adapted from the
					Statistics Canada census. EDI data will be used for anonymous, aggregate Platform reporting as
					well
					as future refinement, and for promoting relevant Platform information (e.g. projects, surveys,
					discussions) to users whose EDI data matches specified information keywords.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					If your personal information has been shared with the Platform prior to accepting the Terms of
					Use
					and Privacy Policy (because you have been invited to the platform), your non-publicly available
					personal information will not be shared until/unless you accept the Terms of Use and Privacy
					Policy
					to activate your account. Publicly available personal information (i.e. name and email address)
					may
					be listed in Platform directories viewable by users for information purposes, but the Platform
					will
					clearly state that you are not a member and therefore cannot be contacted using Platform
					features.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					If you do not accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, you may receive communication from the
					Platform itself requesting that you activate your account and/or promoting Platform services,
					but
					you retain the right to unsubscribe at any time. You also retain the right to request removal of
					your publicly available information from the Platform directory through the ‘Remove From
					Directory’
					page.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					Upon accepting the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, making your Personal Information available
					to
					the Platform or individuals may mean your Personal Information is transferred to a third-party
					email
					provider or to a different country. We cannot limit which third-party email providers other
					users
					employ to communicate with you or which country other users may reside in. All Platform users
					must
					use your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Platform and its
					owners or
					operators are not in any way responsible for other users’ storage, use, or disclosure of user
					data.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					You will also be asked to provide Platform-specific additional information on your profile (e.g.
					clinical specialty, level of training, information about your/your child’s PICU admission). You
					may
					also link one or more social media accounts to your profile. By choosing to complete this
					information and save it in your profile, you agree to the following: (1) logged in Platform
					users
					may have access to your profile and view your information; (2) Platform users who are not logged
					in
					may view personal information on content that has been made public by other users. You control
					the
					information made available on your profile page and available for public viewing; (3) the
					Platform
					may use this information to evaluate or describe the Platform user group in reports or
					publications
					and will only share this information as anonymized, aggregate data.

					The Platform will use your primary email address to administer its platform, which includes
					contacting you about updates to our policies and website, and your secondary email address
					during
					membership renewal and account termination as per the Terms of Use. You may agree to allow the
					Platform to use your Personal Information to contact you with content (e.g. surveys about
					research
					initiatives or clinical inquiries, projects, discussions) that may interest you. You can opt in
					or
					out of these in-platform communications and emails at any time through your profile. Those users
					who
					choose not to receive communications from the Platform accept the responsibility of reviewing
					the
					Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for potential changes at each sign-in.

					Personal Information you entered is deleted from the Platform and its servers. Publicly
					available
					information will be retained in Platform directories as for non-users, but you have the right to
					request that this be removed as well via the ‘Remove From Directory’ page. Any content or survey
					information you contributed will remain the property of relevant users (e.g. survey owners or
					original content posters on whose content you commented or exchanged messages with) and the
					Platform
					and will remain visible to the aforenamed, in accordance with the Terms of Use. Your Personal
					Information held by the Platform is visible to you in your Profile. You may correct or update

					Information until you request to have your account deleted. We will only use or disclose your
					personal information as stated in this policy or as required and permitted by law.

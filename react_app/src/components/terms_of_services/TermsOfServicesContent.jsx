                    The Platform is a space where users can work together with the goal of collaboration and
                    improvement
                    of patient care and health research. Means of interaction with the Platform and other users is
                    platform-specific for all Engage sites. Users who interact with the Platform or
                    other users (e.g. by completing surveys, exchanging messages, creating or commenting on content)
                    do
                    so voluntarily, and by continuing to use the site you expressly acknowledge that you have done
                    so

                    permission to view and use your content, although you retain ownership over proprietary
                    intellectual
                    property, in accordance with Canadian law. Before contributing to multi-user content (e.g.
                    surveys,
                    discussions, projects), activity is based on a 2-step system whereby users can request that the
                    Platform distribute the content they have prepared (they will be considered the owners of that
                    content and responsible for moderating it), and/or users can request permission to contribute to
                    owned content (e.g. can request the owner allow them to join a research project).
